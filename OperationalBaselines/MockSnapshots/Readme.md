#Running the script against remote system
In this folder, the baselines of tested systems are located here. 
For a quickstart, run Invoke-InfrastrucutreValidation with the parameter $MockData=$true
$MackData being set to true will change the script to not query remote systems but instead use the mock data that I'm providing.
